<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project is to create a progressive web application with React, Webpack 5 and Tailwind. I used some others tools to help the development as Postcss, Eslint, Stylint, Babel, etc. 
I will create a smooth analytics dashboard because I am designing a retail dashboard for [https://technis.com](Technis), the company where I work.



### Why React ?

1. Very flexible
2. Great developer experience
3. Huge performance
4. Easy to test
5. Facebook's support/ressources



### Why Webpack ?

💫 **Modern modules** system based on ES6 and built for scale.

🤖 **Speed up** your development environment with features like hot module replacement.

😅 **Easier to set up** a single-page application. Great I want to develope a PWA 

🚀 **Total control** over your builds. 


### Why Tailwind ?

🎨 **Theme anything** that extends tailwind's config and can be expressed in css variables is something you can theme with this plugin, even other plugins

🍨 **Unlimited themes** as you want! This plugin doesn't care!

💫 **Automatically generate** variants for all of your themes (i.e. use classes like my-theme:font-black) to enable classes only when certain themes active.

🌑 **Dark theme** is as easy as naming the theme you create as "dark" (or whatever you want), no special config

🤖 **Colors and opacity:** Using tailwind with css variables can get tricky with colors, but this plugin handles all of that for you!

😅 **Easy theme management:** A simple, declarative api that lets you easily create and modify themes

👋 **Familiar api:** The way you declare themes is the exact same way you extend tailwind with the exact same features


### Why Postcss ?

🎨 **Don't use preprocessor** with tailwind like sass, scss or stylus. Otherwises some issues would happens.

🍨 **Fast build** compared to other preprocessors.

💫 **Write custom plugins** that provide you a total contral of your css compilation.

😅 **A lot of plugins** as nesting for example that provides you nesting your css.
